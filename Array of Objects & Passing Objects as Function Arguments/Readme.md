# An array of Objects in C++
An array of objects is declared the same as any other data-type array.  An array of objects consists of class objects as its elements. If the array consists of class objects it is called an array of objects.

# Passing Object as Function Argument
Objects can be passed as function arguments. This is useful when we want to assign the values of a passed object to the current object.

we created a complex class that has integer “a” variable and “b” integer variable as private class members; and “setData” void function, “setDataBySum” void function, and “printNumber” void function as public class members. These functions are explained below.

We have defined a “setData” function. In this function the values are assigned to the variables “a” and “b” because they are private data members of the class and values cannot be assigned directly. We have defined a “setDataBySum” function. In this function, the values of two objects are added and then assigned to the variables “a” and “b”. We have defined a “printNumber” function. In this function, the values of the variable “a” and “b” are being printed.
